It's easy you must to configurate the file **application.properties** located in **src/main/resources/application.properties**

- replace your MySQL database name in the space {namedatabase} - spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/`{name database}`
- replace your MySQL database user in the space {database user} by default is root - spring.datasource.username=`{database user}`
- replace your MySQL database password in the space {database password} - spring.datasource.password=`{database password}`

It will create a database with some entities inside it. Then you can use the localhost:8080 to do request.
